    <p>This is the best ever Cuban sandwich, pressed and toasted, buttery, Cuban bread layered with shredded pork, ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickle, and dressed with mustard and mayonnaise.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 white onion, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>15 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 oranges, juiced</li>
        <li>3 limes, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 (5 pound) pork shoulder roast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, softened, divided</li>
        <li>1 loaf Cuban bread, cut into 4 pieces and halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded roast pork</li>
        <li>12 ounces thinly sliced deli ham</li>
        <li>12 sandwich-sliced refrigerated kosher dill pickles, such as Claussen Kosher Dill Sandwich Slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare pork shoulder: Add onion, garlic, orange juice, lime juice, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt into a food processor or blender and process until smooth.</li>
        <li>Place pork in the bottom of a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or large baking dish and cut 3 or 4 large deep slits in the meat.  Pour marinade over pork, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Place Dutch oven with prepared pork, covered, in the oven and set the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake until pork is very tender, 3 to 4 hours. Remove from the oven; rest 15 minutes. Remove pork to a cutting board. Skim any fat from the cooking liquid, and set cooking liquid aside.</li>
        <li>Shred pork with two forks, and discard any remaining fat and bone. Return pork to the pot, and add cooking liquid back into meat as needed to moisten.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Heat a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Spread about 2 tablespoons softened butter over cut sides of bread and place bread, buttered sides down, in skillet. Cook until buttered side is lightly browned and toasted, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir mustard and mayonnaise together in a small bowl. Spread about 2 teaspoons mustard mixture over bottom halves of bread and top with 1 slice of cheese, tearing as needed to fit the bread without hanging over the edges. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, add about 1/2 cup shredded pork to each sandwich, draining off any excess liquid. Top each evenly with ham, 3 pickle slices, and 1 cheese slice. Spread remaining mustard mixture evenly over top pieces of bread and place on top.</li>
        <li>Reheat the skillet over medium heat. Spread about 1 tablespoon butter lightly on the outsides of the 4 bottom buns. Working 2 sandwiches at a time, place sandwiches, buttered side down, in skillet. Place 1 or 2 heavy-bottomed skillets on top of sandwiches to weigh them down. Cook until toasted and lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove weighted skillets.</li>
        <li>Spread remaining 1 tablespoon butter over the 4 top halves of sandwiches, flip and press with weighted skillets again until toasted. Remove the first 2 sandwiches from skillet; repeat the toasting process with remaining sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in halves and serve immediately.</li>
